<h3>Linear Systems<h3>

> The goal of this project was to implement the Gauss Elimintation method and Gauss-Seidel method on C language, to accomplish this were used:

* Specific structs
* Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
* Specific Functions 

> All the code in this projected is commented  on every line. In order to compile, follow these steps:

1. Extract the project into one specific folder

2. Enter in the directory you extracted the project and type the following:
    `make`

3. After that, run the program with redirection of error to a specific file, for example "error.txt", with the following:
    `./labSisLin 2> error.txt`

> At this point you should start to see the output of the program, enjoy it!
